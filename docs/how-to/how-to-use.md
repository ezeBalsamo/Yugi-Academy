## Models and their relationship

The main idea behind is that:

- There are cards.

- There are booster packs.

- There are cards belonging to booster packs.

This is a like the so-called 'many-to-many relationship':
a card may belong to many booster packs and a booster pack may have many cards.
A card belonging to a booster pack has an identifier and a rarity.

With all this being said, you can play around registering some spell cards.
