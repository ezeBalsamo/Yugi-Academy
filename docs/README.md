# Yugi Academy Documentation

Your place to learn all about Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, sets, ban lists and much more.

## Context

The aim of the project is to show information about Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, booster packs, ban lists and everything related to the TCG game.

This information will be consumed from this [API](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php). You can know more about this API by reading its [guide](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/).
Also, this information can be stored, updated and/or deleted by an administrator (a user with specific permissions).

A regular user of this system (already registered and logged in to the application) can query:
- Cards
- Booster packs
- Ban lists
- Much more

With all this, the user can select its favourite cards in order to build the ultimate deck.

Moreover, the user will be able to chat with other users and edit its own profile information.
